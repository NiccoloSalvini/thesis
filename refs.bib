 abstract = {In this paper, an analysis is made of what would be the rent difference for the tenants of subsidised units if these units were rented as unsubsidised units. Furthermore, the existence of any pecuniary disadvantage for the owner of a subsidised unit is investigated by considering his rental revenue (i.e. the amount paid by the tenant and the subsidy). It is found that there exists a premium between an unsubsidised and a subsidised unit when using the amount paid by the tenant (i.e. the rent) as the dependent variable. Also, the subsidy system in Geneva has an influence on the pricing of each characteristic of a unit. Furthermore, it is found that when using rental revenue as the dependent variable, both sub-samples can be used in a single hedonic equation. Thus, owners of subsidised units are not at a disadvantage due to the granting of a subsidy. As a result, Geneva's subsidy system matches the goals of agents on both the demand and supply sides.},

  abstract = {Customarily, for housing markets, interest focuses on selling prices of properties at locations and times. Hedonic models are employed using property-level, neighborhood-level, and economic regressors. However, in hedonic modeling the fact that the locations and times of property transactions are random is ignored. Here, we focus on explanation of the locations of transactions in space and time, viewing them as a point pattern over space and time. Our contribution is to explain such a point pattern using suitable regressors. We examine two explanatory models, the nonhomogeneous Poisson process and the log Gaussian Cox process. We study a point pattern in the city of Zaragoza, Spain, over the years, 2006–2014. We argue for point level modeling since the process of property sales operates at that scale. We elaborate efficient computation for fitting the foregoing models to the Zaragoza data. We show how the modeling enables rich inference and extraction of novel stories for this market over this time period. In addition, we clarify the potential benefits of this modeling for brokers, buyers, and administrators. To our knowledge, this is the first application of formal space–time point pattern analysis to locations of urban real estate transactions.}

  abstract = { This paper investigates some problems associated with an argument evaluation order that we call “future” order, which is different from both call-by-name and call-by-value, In call-by-future, each formal parameter of a function is bound to a separate process (called a “future”) dedicated to the evaluation of the corresponding argument. This mechanism allows the fully parallel evaluation of arguments to a function, and has been shown to augment the expressive power of a language. We discuss an approach to a problem that arises in this context: futures which were thought to be relevant when they were created become irrelevant through being ignored in the body of the expression where they were bound. The problem of irrelevant processes also appears in multiprocessing problem-solving systems which start several processors working on the same problem but with different methods, and return with the solution which finishes first. This parallel method strategy has the drawback that the processes which are investigating the losing methods must be identified, stopped, and re-assigned to more useful tasks. },

  abstract = {Summary This chapter addresses three main aspects of web scraping with R. The first is how to retrieve data from the Web in different scenarios. The chapter looks at the stage where one can try to get resources from servers into R. It provides an introduction to Selenium, a browser automation tool that can be used to gather content from JavaScript-enriched pages. The chapter turns to strategies for extracting information from gathered resources. It sheds light on these techniques from a more practical perspective, providing a stylized sketch of the strategies and discuss their advantages and disadvantages. The chapter addresses an important, but sometimes disregarded aspect of web scraping. It deals with the question of how to behave nicely on the Web as a web scraper. The chapter concludes with a glimpse of ongoing efforts for giving R more interfaces with web data and on lighthouses of web scraping more generally.}

Their main challenge focusses around computation, but the advent of Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods (MCMC) and in particular of the WinBUGS software has opened the doors of Bayesian modelling to the wide research community. However model complexity and database dimension still remain a constraint. Recently the use of Gaussian random fields has become increasingly popular in epidemiology as very often epidemiological data are characterised by a spatial and/or temporal structure which needs to be taken into account in the inferential process. The Integrated Nested Laplace Approximation (INLA) approach has been developed as a computationally efficient alternative to MCMC and the availability of an R package (R-INLA) allows researchers to easily apply this method. In this paper we review the INLA approach and present some applications on spatial and spatio-temporal data.}

  abstract={This paper is motivated by automated valuation systems, which would benefit from an ability to estimate spatial variation in location value. It develops theory for the local regression model (LRM), a semiparametric approach to estimating a location value surface. There are two parts to the LRM: (1) an ordinary least square (OLS) model to hold constant for interior square footage, land area, bathrooms, and other structural characteristics; and (2) a non-parametric smoother (local polynomial regression, LPR) which calculates location value as a function of latitude and longitude. Several methods are used to consistently estimate both parts of the model. The LRM was fit to geocoded hedonic sales data for six towns in the suburbs of Boston, MA. The estimates yield substantial, significant and plausible spatial patterns in location values. Using the LRM as an exploratory tool, local peaks and valleys in location value identified by the model are close to points identified by the tax assessor, and they are shown to add to the explanatory power of an OLS model. Out-of-sample MSE shows that the LRM with a first-degree polynomial (local linear smoothing) is somewhat better than polynomials of degree zero or degree two. Future applications might use degree zero (the well-known NW estimator) because this is available in popular commercial software. The optimized LRM reduces MSE from the OLS model by between 5 percent and 11 percent while adding information on statistically significant variations in location value.

A study into geographical variability of reproductive health outcomes (e.g. birth weight) in Upper Cape Cod, Massachusetts, USA, benefits from geostatistical mapping or kriging. However, also observed are some continuous covariates (e.g. maternal age) that exhibit pronounced non-linear relationships with the response variable. To account for such effects properly we merge kriging with additive models to obtain what we call geoadditive models. The merging becomes effortless by expressing both as linear mixed models. The resulting mixed model representation for the geoadditive model allows for fitting and diagnosis using standard methodology and software.},

  abstract = {We propose a geoadditive negative binomial model (Geo-NB-GAM) for regional count data that allows us to address simultaneously some important methodological issues, such as spatial clustering, nonlinearities, and overdispersion. This model is applied to the study of location determinants of inward greenfield investments that occurred during 2003–2007 in 249 European regions. After presenting the data set and showing the presence of overdispersion and spatial clustering, we review the theoretical framework that motivates the choice of the location determinants included in the empirical model, and we highlight some reasons why the relationship between some of the covariates and the dependent variable might be nonlinear. The subsequent section first describes the solutions proposed by previous literature to tackle spatial clustering, nonlinearities, and overdispersion, and then presents the Geo-NB-GAM. The empirical analysis shows the good performance of Geo-NB-GAM. Notably, the inclusion of a geoadditive component (a smooth spatial trend surface) permits us to control for spatial unobserved heterogeneity that induces spatial clustering. Allowing for nonlinearities reveals, in keeping with theoretical predictions, that the positive effect of agglomeration economies fades as the density of economic activities reaches some threshold value. However, no matter how dense the economic activity becomes, our results suggest that congestion costs never overcome positive agglomeration externalities.},

However, the exogenous weights matrix is usually developed in a strictly spatial context, even when data are collected over time. This paper develops a spatio-temporal weights matrix and uses the new definition to evaluate spatial dependence using Moran's I index applied to real estate data for Québec City from 1986 to 1996. The results are compared with the original Moran's I index using a strictly spatial weights matrix specification based on Euclidian distance or contiguity. The findings suggest that ignoring the temporal dimension could lead to misinterpretation of the ‘real’ measure of spatial dependence over time. However, the time dimension cannot explain the total spatial autocorrelation since the Moran's I index is still significant even when adjusting for time consideration. The differences between the estimated indices and statistics depend on the structure of the spatial and the temporal weights matrices that are used to construct the complete spatio-temporal weights matrix.},

  abstract = {SummaryThis paper estimates a hedonic housing model based on flats sold in the city of Paris over the period 1990–2003. This is done using maximum likelihood estimation, taking into account the nested structure of the data. Paris is historically divided into 20 arrondissements, each divided into four quartiers (quarters), which in turn contain between 15 and 169 blocks (îlot, in French) per quartier. This is an unbalanced pseudo‒panel data containing 156,896 transactions. Despite the richness of the data, many neighborhood characteristics are not observed, and we attempt to capture these neighborhood spillover effects using a spatial lag model. Using likelihood ratio tests, we find significant spatial lag effects as well as significant nested random error effects. The empirical results show that the hedonic housing estimates and the corresponding marginal effects are affected by taking into account the nested aspects of the Paris housing data as well as the spatial neighborhood effects.Copyright © 2014 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

  abstract = { The key operation in Bayesian inference is to compute high-dimensional integrals. An old approximate technique is the Laplace method or approximation, which dates back to Pierre-Simon Laplace (1774). This simple idea approximates the integrand with a second-order Taylor expansion around the mode and computes the integral analytically. By developing a nested version of this classical idea, combined with modern numerical techniques for sparse matrices, we obtain the approach of integrated nested Laplace approximations (INLA) to do approximate Bayesian inference for latent Gaussian models (LGMs). LGMs represent an important model abstraction for Bayesian inference and include a large proportion of the statistical models used today. In this review, we discuss the reasons for the success of the INLA approach, the R-INLA package, why it is so accurate, why the approximations are very quick to compute, and why LGMs make such a useful concept for Bayesian computing. }

  abstract = {SUMMARY The conditional predictive ordinate (CPO) is a Bayesian diagnostic which detects surprising observations. It has been used in a variety of situations such as univariate samples, the multivariate normal distribution and regression models. Results are presented about the most surprising observation which has minimum CPO. For the multivariate normal distribution it is shown that the most surprising observation must lie at one of the vertices of the convex hull. It is also shown that the observation with maximum Mahalanobis distance from the sample mean must lie on the convex hull. Results are given for the expected number of vertices on the convex hull when the sample is contaminated. An alternative, closely related diagnostic, the ratio ordinate measure, is presented. A numerical comparison of the two measures is given.},

 abstract = {In the analysis of data it is often assumed that observations y1, y2, ..., yn are independently normally distributed with constant variance and with expectations specified by a model linear in a set of parameters θ. In this paper we make the less restrictive assumption that such a normal, homoscedastic, linear model is appropriate after some suitable transformation has been applied to the y's. Inferences about the transformation and about the parameters of the linear model are made by computing the likelihood function and the relevant posterior distribution. The contributions of normality, homoscedasticity and additivity to the transformation are separated. The relation of the present methods to earlier procedures for finding transformations is discussed. The methods are illustrated with examples.},
